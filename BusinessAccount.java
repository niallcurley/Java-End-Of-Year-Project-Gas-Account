/**
 *This BusinessAccount Class is an extension of the GasAccount class. It allows 
 * for a business account to have a reduced discount on the total cost of units used. 
 * This discount is initially set at 10% but can be reset according to method setDblDiscount.
 * The method recordUnits will override the superclass method to calculate the balance of
 * a GasAccount object with the objectâ€™s discount applied to the cost of the new units
 * which in turn will be added to current balance of a BusinessAccount object.
 * This method will return a string value, ' Transaction Successful ' or Error - must 
 * be positive value.
